Concrete
1. We assume that the depth of bearing is 0.15(=Greek standard)
2. Concrete_wall in m^3
3. We assume that wall height is 3m (average home height)
4. We assume that wall thickness is 25cm
6. We assume that houses are square (to calculate wall length) so 4 sides
7. Brick_wall in m^2
8. We assume glass_windows are as thick as wall
9. Glass_windows (height, length, elevation=height from floor).
10. Max window area = Brick Wall total * Max glass height(2.20)
11. Assuming 120kg of steel per m^3 of concrete
